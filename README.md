# Where Am I

This is the localization assignment from my Udacity Robotics course.  In this assignment, I learned how to use the AMCL and MoveBase packages to localize a simulated robot with a map, and how to adjust the parameters of the AMCL package to get better localization results.

Here are some screenshots of the robot localizing itself:
